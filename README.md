# Circuit-Design-using-OpenLane-SKY130PDK-VLSI-
These are different circuit designs made using the open-source automated RTL to GDSII flow, i.e. OpenLane, using SKY130 PDK, which is a 130nm process design kit (PDK) provided by SkyWater Technology Foundry

Running these designs in colab requires you to first download 'requirements-dev.txt' file and upload it into Google Colab. Then restart the runtime and run each cell one after the other.
